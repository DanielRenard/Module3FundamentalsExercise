//2. Which of the below are not giving the right answer? Why are they not correct? 
//How can we fix them?

// let three = "3"
// let four = "4"
// let thirty = "30"

// let three = 3
// let four = 4
// let thirty = 30

// let addition = three + four
// console.log(addition) //prints as 34 but is actually 7; 
// //removing quotes around strings makes them numbers and prints as 7

// let multiplication = three * four
// console.log(multiplication) //12

// let division = three / four
// console.log(division) //0.75

// let subtraction = three - four
// console.log(subtraction) //-1

// let lessThan1 = three < four
// console.log(lessThan1) //true

// let lessThan2 = thirty < four
// console.log(lessThan2) // prints as true but is actually false; 
// //removing quotes around strings makes them numbers and prints as false
